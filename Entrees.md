## Recipe ideas
- Existing recipes from cook'n and whisk 🍲
- New pretzel recipe 🥨 
- Recipes with basil? 🌿
- Set up an online cookbook with sections and links
	- Each recipe should be a separate file / page so mobile access is easy for editing and working in the kitchen
	- Sections could be food types like entrées and breads, possibly preceded by "Chapter n" if necessary to sort them, essentially these are lists of links
	- Include ingredients in description to prevent the need for scrolling while cooking, but don't overdo it the way the cookn app does
	- Include where recipes came from, with a picture or link, after the information needed for cooking
	- Set up the Readme.md but don't include it in the cookbook, it can include information about contributing
	- Make it interesting reading for family and recipe contributors? 
	- Since this is on the web, don't include too much personal information
	- Invite people to share their favorite recipes, and try to get at least one from each person interested
	- Recipes from sibling dinner restaurants?
